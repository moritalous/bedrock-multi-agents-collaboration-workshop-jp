# Energy Efficiency Management System - Multi-Agent Workshop

## Overview
This workshop showcases the new Amazon Bedrock Agents' [multi-agent collaboration capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-multi-agents-collaboration.html) through an Energy Efficiency Management System. 
The system consists of a supervisor agent that orchestrates three specialized sub-agents, each handling specific aspects of energy management and customer service.

## Agents Description

### Energy Efficiency Management Agent (Supervisor)
The supervisor agent coordinates the activities of three specialized sub-agents, 
routing customer queries and requests to the appropriate agent while maintaining context and 
ensuring seamless interactions. The architecture looks as following:
